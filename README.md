# Thrown For A Loop: C# Console Application

## Overview

This is a learning project built as part of the [Nashville Software School's Server-Side .NET Curriculum](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/server-side-dotnet-curriculum). The purpose of this exercise is to build foundational fluency in C# and .NET Core through practical hands-on development.

The current application simulates a basic console-based inventory system. It allows a user to view available products and select one to see its details. This project focuses on mastering key concepts like:

- Class design and object instantiation
- Collections (`List<T>`)
- Loops and conditionals
- Input validation
- String interpolation
- Console I/O

---

## Technologies

- C# 12
- .NET 8.0
- Visual Studio Code (macOS)
- Terminal-based execution

---

## Goals & Learning Outcomes

✅ Understand how to define and use C# classes and objects  
✅ Learn basic console input and output  
✅ Practice writing clean, readable loops and conditional logic  
✅ Gain familiarity with the .NET build process (`dotnet run`, `dotnet build`)  
✅ Build comfort working with multiple files in a C# project

## My Commitment

I'm treating this course as a serious step in transitioning to professional software development. I am:

- Writing clean and well-commented code
- Committing regularly with meaningful messages
- Seeking to deeply understand the logic behind each concept
- Applying real-world analogies to internalize programming patterns
- Documenting my learning journey to show growth and professionalism

---

## What's Next

As I continue through the curriculum, I will:

- Refactor this project as I learn new patterns (e.g. error handling, encapsulation)
- Begin working with file I/O, data structures, and interfaces
- Build larger console apps and eventually transition into ASP.NET MVC apps

Follow my journey here or on [GitHub](https://github.com/danielrhodes11) as I build from the ground up, sharpening my backend development skills with C# and .NET.
